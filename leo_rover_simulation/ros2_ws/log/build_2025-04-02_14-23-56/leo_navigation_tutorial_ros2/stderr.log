  By not providing "Findgui_controller_leo.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "gui_controller_leo", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "gui_controller_leo" with any of the following names:

    gui_controller_leoConfig.cmake
    gui_controller_leo-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gui_controller_leo" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "gui_controller_leo_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "gui_controller_leo" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
